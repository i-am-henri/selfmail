### What is selfmail?

Selfmail is an open-source email provider, built with nextjs and cloudflare email workers, which you can selfhost. Our platform is completely free to use, with no hidden textes. You can host the entire platform, or only the backend and building your frontend by yourself. If you want to use a hosted version then you should check our platform out [here](https://selfmail.io). You can start free, later you can upgrade to a paid plan for more space. All features (expect the ai features) are the same in every plan.
